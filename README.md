# Falling Thirds
An Ambient music HTML5 Audio app by Christopher Alcock

Falling Thirds is my most complete HTML5 Audio app as of March 2016.  It plays randomly inverted, randomly sped, randomly looped, randomly delayed, randomly panned quasi arpeggios in a falling thirds chord pattern, chosen as the unstrictly-sychronised loops will not clash with eachother, as the anteceding and preceding chords will always be harmonious, a la Music for 18 Musicians.

The chord is determined by your clock (how many second into the month you are, to be precise), so as long as your clocks are accurate to within about 20 seconds, you can open the site on multiple devices and experience the sound environment in surround.

The delay/echo effect on the notes adds a lot to the texture, but can be quite resource intensive, and so I've limited the buttons on the page to 5 concurrent layers of notes.

I owe a lot of gratitude to my friends who have advised me on code issues, Joe Corcoron, Daniel Harvey and Alex Norman.
